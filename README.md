# landing-page-php
 This code creates a simple landing page in php, with mysql support. During development I used XAMPP to create to test out both the functionality of the page and the mysql behaviours. Before running the code it's important to see, if there is a database with the name SRI2024, as the code creates the SQL table in that database(and in case it does not exist, it gets created). Unless there is some data in the SRI2024 database named user, it is wise to change it.

This was a bit of a rush job as it needed to be finished in time, took about 3-4 hours to create it, while being under pressure in my job as there is a deadline approaching.
